# DESCRIPTION

This module can be used to instrument code using [Kafka::Librd](https://metacpan.org/pod/Kafka%3A%3ALibrd) to generate
trace data using the [OpenTelemetry](https://metacpan.org/pod/OpenTelemetry) API. See [OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation](https://metacpan.org/pod/OpenTelemetry%3A%3AInstrumentation)
for more details.

The instrumentation provided by this module wraps around several methods in
the Kafka::Librd classes to try to automatically generate as much telemetry
data as possible. See below for details on what methods are wrapped and
details about how the data they generate.

## Configuration

This instrumentation accepts the following configuration parameters:

- create\_poll\_span

    If set to a true value, a span will be created wrapping around the
    `consumer_poll` method. This key allows this to be disabled since in most
    consumer applications this method will be called repeatedly, and it may result
    in noisy telemetry data.

    Defaults to a true value.

- create\_process\_span

    If set to a true value, this instrumentation will create a span that wraps
    around the code processing the message returned by `consumer_poll`.

    Defaults to a true value.

- key\_processor

    If set to a sub reference, this will be called whenever the code in this
    instrumentation wants to access a message's key. The key processor will
    receive as its only argument the message key as it was received in the
    message from Kafka. The processor is expected to return a value that is
    suitable to be used as the key when generating telemetry.

    The user is responsible for making sure the processor does not die. This
    instrumentation includes no protections against this.

    This option defaults to an undefined value, meaning no processor is used.

- key\_uses\_schema\_framing

    Kafka-based applications that use the Confluent Schema Registry (or an
    equivalent solution) will sometimes produce messages that employ what is
    called "schema framing". When using it, the first five bytes of the message
    payload and/or key will not be part of the actual data, but will encode
    information about the schema that was used to encode that particular datum.

    Since this instrumentation will in some cases attach the message key to a
    span's attributes, this option can be used to strip these five-byte headers
    from the key before storing it in the generated span.

    This option is incompatible with the ["key\_processor"](#key_processor) option, since it is
    in effect a shortcut for installing a processor that strips the schema
    framing.

    Defaults to a false value.

# WRAPPED METHODS

## Kafka::Librd::consumer\_poll

By default, this instrumentation will generate two spans when calling
["consumer\_poll" in Kafka::Librd](https://metacpan.org/pod/Kafka%3A%3ALibrd#consumer_poll).

### The poll span

This span will wrap around the call to "consumer\_poll" itself. It can be
disabled by setting `create_poll_span` to a false value on installation, as
described above.

If created, this span will be named `poll` and will include the following
attributes:

- `messaging.system`

    Set to `kafka`.

- `messaging.operation.name`

    Set to `poll`.

- `messaging.operation.type`

    Set to `receive`.

### The process span

This span aims to wrap around the code processing a message. In practice, this
will be a span that starts after `consumer_poll` receives a message, and ends
the next time `consumer_poll` is called. This should work as expected in most
cases, but since this span will in effect be capturing code that runs in an
outer scope, this might not always be desired. If so, this can be disabled
by setting `create_process_span` to a false value during installation, as
described above.

If created, this span will be named `process_$topic`, where `$topic` is the
topic the message was received from. If the version of [Kafka::Librd](https://metacpan.org/pod/Kafka%3A%3ALibrd)
supports reading a message's headers, this instrumentation will extract
propagation data from the headers so the "process" span can link to the traces
that produced the message being processed. The span will include the following
attributes:

- `messaging.system`

    Set to `kafka`.

- `messaging.operation.name`

    Set to `process`.

- `messaging.operation.type`

    Set to `process`.

- `messaging.destination.name`

    Set to the value returned by ["topic" in Kafka::Librd::Message](https://metacpan.org/pod/Kafka%3A%3ALibrd%3A%3AMessage#topic).

- `messaging.kafka.offset`

    Set to the value returned by ["offset" in Kafka::Librd::Message](https://metacpan.org/pod/Kafka%3A%3ALibrd%3A%3AMessage#offset).

- `messaging.destination.partition.id`

    Set to the value returned by ["partition" in Kafka::Librd::Message](https://metacpan.org/pod/Kafka%3A%3ALibrd%3A%3AMessage#partition) if this
    returns a defined value.

- `messaging.kafka.message.key`

    Set to the value returned by ["key" in Kafka::Librd::Message](https://metacpan.org/pod/Kafka%3A%3ALibrd%3A%3AMessage#key), possibly after
    being processed by the ["key\_processor"](#key_processor) if one was set on installation.

## Kafka::Librd::commit\_message

When calling ["commit\_message" in Kafka::Librd](https://metacpan.org/pod/Kafka%3A%3ALibrd#commit_message), this instrumentation will create
a "settle" span with the name `commit_$topic`, where `$topic` is the topic
the message was received from. If the version of [Kafka::Librd](https://metacpan.org/pod/Kafka%3A%3ALibrd) supports
reading headers, these will be used to read propagation data, and the span
will be linked to the spans that produced the message being committed.

The span will be created with the attributes described below:

- `messaging.system`

    Set to `kafka`.

- `messaging.operation.name`

    Set to `commit`.

- `messaging.operation.type`

    Set to `settle`.

- `messaging.destination.name`

    Set to the value returned by ["topic" in Kafka::Librd::Message](https://metacpan.org/pod/Kafka%3A%3ALibrd%3A%3AMessage#topic).

- `messaging.destination.partition.id`

    Set to the value returned by ["partition" in Kafka::Librd::Message](https://metacpan.org/pod/Kafka%3A%3ALibrd%3A%3AMessage#partition) if this
    returns a defined value.

## Kafka::Librd::producev

When calling ["producev" in Kafka::Librd](https://metacpan.org/pod/Kafka%3A%3ALibrd#producev), this instrumentation will create
a "send" span with the name `send_$topic`, where `$topic` is the topic
the message is being sent to. Since the message headers will be modified
to inject propagation data from the current context, this may result in
some headers being replaced. The keys that will be used will depend on the
propagators you've got configured.

The span will be created with the attributes described below:

- `messaging.system`

    Set to `kafka`.

- `messaging.operation.name`

    Set to `send`.

- `messaging.operation.type`

    Set to `send`.

- `messaging.destination.name`

    Set to the value passed as the `topic` parameter.

- `messaging.destination.partition.id`

    Set to the value passed as the `partition` parameter, if set to a defined
    value.

- `messaging.kafka.message.key`

    Set to the value passed as the `key` parameter, if set to a defined value,
    possibly after being processed by the ["key\_processor"](#key_processor) if one was set on
    installation.

## Kafka::Librd::Topic::produce

When calling ["produce" in Kafka::Librd::Topic](https://metacpan.org/pod/Kafka%3A%3ALibrd%3A%3ATopic#produce), this instrumentation will create
a "send" span with the name `send`. Ideally this should include the topic
name, but at the time of writing [Kafka::Librd::Topic](https://metacpan.org/pod/Kafka%3A%3ALibrd%3A%3ATopic) does not provide a way
to retrieve the name of the topic that it points to.

Since this method does not support setting headers, no propagation data will
be added. If supported, please consider using ["producev" in Kafka::Librd](https://metacpan.org/pod/Kafka%3A%3ALibrd#producev) instead.

The span will be created with the attributes described below:

- `messaging.system`

    Set to `kafka`.

- `messaging.operation.name`

    Set to `send`.

- `messaging.operation.type`

    Set to `send`.

- `messaging.destination.partition.id`

    Set to the value passed as the `partition` parameter, if set to a defined
    value.

- `messaging.kafka.message.key`

    Set to the value passed as the `key` parameter, if set to a defined value,
    possibly after being processed by the ["key\_processor"](#key_processor) if one was set on
    installation.
